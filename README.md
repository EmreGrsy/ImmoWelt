# ImmoWelt
A simple websrapper for ImmoWelt


A toy model to play with bs4. I don't suggest anyone to use it "just yet" its super experimental, meaning it will probably not work properly.
It needs
- [x] More efficent coding with try/except.
- [x] Get rid off the redundant for loops.
- [x] Scrap more information from the website.
- [ ] Change getLinks class so it can gather all the website information.
- [ ] Change the saved data structure to CSV or SQL.
